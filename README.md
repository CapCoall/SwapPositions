# SwapPositions
In this Unity3D project, I based the mechanics on a science fiction game I saw. The player interacts with objects using the 'E' key in different ways. When the 'E' key is pressed for the first time, a connection is established with the object, allowing the player to determine its position. When pressed again, the player and the object swap places. However, if the key is held down for a long time, the connection between the player and the object is severed, preventing the swap from occurring. This mechanic offers the player various strategic options when interacting with the environment.
